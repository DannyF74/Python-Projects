Here are some of the Python projects I've worked on during my time at The Tech Academy.

## Projects:
* [Phonebook](https://github.com/DannyF74/Python-Projects/tree/main/Phonebook_Project)
* [Check Files Gui](https://github.com/DannyF74/Python-Projects/blob/main/Python_Challenges/File_Transfer.py)
* [Web Page Generator](https://github.com/DannyF74/Python-Projects/blob/main/Web_Page_Generator/web_page_generator.py)
* [Truth or Lie Game](https://github.com/DannyF74/Python-Projects/blob/main/Mean_Nice_Game/Truth_and_Lie_game.py)

### Phonebook
This project functions as a phonebook for a user. It saves a contacts name, phone number and email address in a database and allows the user to update and delete previously stored entries.

### Check Files Gui
This project allows the user to choose transfer all .txt files from one chosen directory to another. All files that are moved will be saved in a database.

### Web Page Generator
An app that creates a generic web page with the option to create a custom web page

### Truth or Lie Game
This is a text based game giving the user an options to tell the truth or a lie. This stores the inputs of the user into variables and passes those variables to different functions. The program follows different paths depending on the inputs.
